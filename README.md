### Coding Challenge ###

This is a coding challenge that will test your React.js and Firebase abilities. Google Firebase is a useful backend tool that we will be using - for this challenge you will not need extensive Firebase experience, just a simple database connection will do. If you feel more comfortable using other online database servers like MongoDB Atlas or SQL-related databases, that is fine too (Firebase will probably be easier though, even if you're new to it). This project should not take more than an afternoon, but you have the week to complete it.

### Overview ###
Create a simple web app that takes the following user information input:
  - username (string)
  - password (string)
  - isSeller (boolean)
  - isBuyer (boolean)
  
Then upload this data as an object "UserProfile" to a Google Firebase server (or server of your choosing). Using APIs, then create 'Seller' and 'Buyer' routes/controllers that GET and show all the usernames depending on if *isSeller* is true and/or *isBuyer* is true. Basically, all we're looking for is a place to submit the user information, and a *Seller* and *Buyer* button that return usernames of all the sellers and buyers. Do not worry about authentication at all, they can be public, unprotected objects. *Note: Users can be both sellers and buyers, and in that case should show up in both cases.


### Information ###
  - We suggest using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to quickly get a React project up and running quickly. 
  - Do not worry about how it looks on the front-end. Functionality is what matters.
